important notes:
- the navbar stays the same no matter which page we are on. 
- Based on the path, different components load (that is why i have two different versions of ExamTable for the Exams page and the Admin page)
- the Admin table is not looking the way it should, it overflows outside of the webpage
- to do: make admin table size down
